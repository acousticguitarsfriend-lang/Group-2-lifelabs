## 1. Introduction

Slow or bad internet is typically caused by network congestion, outdated hardware, weak signals, or infrastructure limitations. It disrupts work, communication, streaming, and online tasks, causing frustration and lower productivity. External interference, incorrect settings, or limited bandwidth in busy areas can also be factors.

## 3. Our Experiences While Creating the Website

In my experience Slow internet is really exhausting. Sometimes I’m just trying to watch a video or look something up, and it keeps buffering and buffering. When I log in for remote classes or calls, the screen is frozen or the audio cuts out, and I end up missing key information. Even small things like scrolling or opening a webpage feel more of a hassle than they should. Others might not think it's much of a problem, but when it happens almost every day, it really affects my focus, my mood, and how productive I can be

while creating our website we experienced slow internet which made uploading and testing difficult some pages loaded slowly and we had to retry many times. despite this we worked together, solved the problems, and successfully finished our website. This helped us understand the importance of having a stable internet connection - 

Our experience whilst creating this website was complex as we had to go through files and coding, but we still managed to work through it and create this website.

I've dealt with poor internet, which made it extremely difficult to use online ICT tools such as cloud storage and collaboration platforms. Files would take hours to upload or download, and real-time editing functions would frequently freeze or fail to sync. The most difficult times occurred during virtual classes, where poor bandwidth produced chronic audio/video issues, making it difficult to follow discussions and even resulting in missed deadlines for completing my experience guides activity or IPBAs.

My experience whenever I experience Slow internet— is that it gets me worked up and frustrated, and especially when it comes to accessing experience guides in google classroom, submitting outputs— homeworks, sending messages, doing activities digitally and so. Not only this affects students but also directly impacts the ICT field that focuses on software, telecommunications, networking, etc.

Creating the website was a challenging but rewarding experience. I learned how to use html tags properly and fix small errors in the code It helped me improve my patience, problem solving skills, and understanding of how websites work
